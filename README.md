This repository is dedicated to storing and organizing my algorithm implementations from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.cn). All source files are named according to their corresponding LeetCode problem IDs.

Every solution in this repository has been tested and successfully accepted by the LeetCode online judge.

As I am not a professional ACMer, these solutions may not always be the most optimal. I warmly welcome any suggestions, discussions, or optimizations — feel free to explore the code, share your ideas, or open an issue for communication!

Happy coding!

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

#### Compiler

- **macOS**: Install **Xcode Command Line Tools** (`xcode-select --install`).
- **Windows**: Install **MinGW-w64** (to get `g++`) or **Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC)** build tools.
- **Linux**: Install `build-essential` (which includes `g++`).

#### IDE/Editor

Any C++ IDE supporting C++17 or later (**Visual Studio Code** is recommended).

### Workflow in VS Code

All C++ source files are written in **standard C++17**. A custom build task is provided in `.vscode/tasks.json` for a seamless experience:

1. Open the project folder in VS Code.
2. Open any `.cpp` source file.
3. Press `Cmd + Shift + B` (macOS) or `Ctrl + Shift + B` (Windows).
4. The executable will be generated in the `bin/` directory and executed automatically in the integrated terminal.

### Code Style

This project includes a `.clang-format` file to ensure code consistency. For the best development experience, it is highly recommended to install the **clangd** extension in VS Code.
